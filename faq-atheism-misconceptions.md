# Theist Misconceptions about Atheism

I've talked with thousands of theists of all stripes over the last decade both in-person and online. So many of them seem not to understand what atheism is despite claiming to; coming to wrong and contradictory conclusions about the atheist with which they're conversing. This part of the book is dedicated to clearing many common misconceptions out there, with questions and claims provided by my many previous discussions.

### Atheists are rebelling against a god they actually believe in

This misconception isn't even really a misconception to many Christians, because this notion is directly taught by the Bible in places like 1 Romans 1:18-21. However, just because a holy text says something doesn't make it true. The very definition of atheism (laid out previously in the book) does not fit this notion at all. To believe in a deity is to be a theist. If we are "rebelling against a god we actually believe in", then we're not atheists, we're rebelling theists. 

This leads into the notion that atheists are "angry at god." Again, no we're not. At least not all of us. If you're angry with something you don't believe exists, that is an issue if it affects your life and beliefs, and should be worked through. While it's entirely possible to feel things toward beings you don't believe are real (look at how many people straight-up hate Jar Jar Binks!), to say that "I'm angry with you so I'm just not gonna acknowledge your existence" is fairly absurd for the vast majority of people.

### Atheists cannot have meaning in their life

This at first seems obviously nonsensical, but there's a whole can of worms here. "Meaning" to life is a fairly abstract and vacuous concept, and if I ask what that means, I have historically gotten different answers from everyone who asks. What does it mean for life to have meaning? Years of dealing with life and all the rucus it throws at me every day has not borne an answer. The notion becomes more garbled every day. Change the question a bit: "What do I want my life to be?" *Now* you have a stepping stone toward finding what fulfills you and brings joy to yourself and others. What mark do you want to leave on the world? Who do you want to help? What do you want to build? What do you want to learn? What do you want to discover? These questions seem far more important, and their answers come as close as possible to some kind of "meaning."

The fact that we're only here for a short time should be more than enough to get anyone who cares enough off their chair and living their best life every moment, because you only have so many of those moments to go around. The very fact that you will die someday and that is the sum total of your conscious existence makes the time you have valuable. Time is a non-renewable resource. How will you use it?

### Atheism is the most important component of the atheist's life

If this is truly the case, we need to get our shit together because our priorities are backward. It is not true in all or even most cases that atheism is the center of an atheist's life. The individual defines that center. Their center might be their career that they love, their service to the community, a hobby they can't get enough of... I can't speak for everyone, only myself. My center is writing, music, study, cooking and nutrition, baguazhang, computer programming, and many other things. To make a single position on a single claim the center of your life seems to me foolhardy.

### Atheists are incapable of morality

### Atheism is a religion

### Atheism is related to evolution

### Atheists believe gods don't exist

### Atheists are Satanists

### Atheism requires certain answers to big worldview questions

### Atheism leads to nihilism

### Atheists choose to go to hell

This one is too easy to counter. Atheists don't acknowledge hell as a reality, just as they don't acknowledge God and Satan as realities. Choosing to go to a place they don't believe exists doesn't make sense. Most all *people*, regardless of beliefs, don't want to be burned forever. It's really that simple. It's just Christians spin that to say "well hell is just the consequence of living a godless life and they chose to live a godless life." It is the absolute pinnacle of dishonest manipulation and I'm hard-pressed to find anything more disgusting in the Christian worldview.

### Atheists are atheist because of some past trauma

Once again I'm forced to reiterate that this isn't true in the vast majority of cases. Many of these are generalizations. While it may happen that someone turned from God from something that befell them, I disagree that's a justified way to throw off a belief. A belief should stand on its ability to be demonstrated, not on everything going peachy in your life.

### Atheists are required to prove gods don't exist
