# Atheist FAQ - Primer on Logic

Anyone can say anything they want. There are millions of claims out there. As such, it's up to the person making the claim to provide evidence in support of it if they aim to convince, and it's up to you to decide what to believe. How do you decide? By using logic in your assessment of the claim.

In logic, a claim is called a proposition. A *proposition* is something that is either true or false, not both or neither. A personal opinion isn’t true or false, but a preference of thought, and so is not a proposition. 

Logic comes down to propositions, because the truth value (truth or falsity) of a proposition can be tested with logical proofs.

So what exactly is logic then? Logic is the laying down of a set of things said to be the case, and then deriving of other things that must also be the case because of the first set - the establishment of *axioms* to make a set of *inferences* off of them.

Reality works under a set amount of immutable behaviors from which everything else stems. Observation of these is how one can make sense of the world around us. 

The laws of logic are descriptions for the rules under which humankind has observed reality working for most of their history. Keep in mind that the laws of logic are only man-made descriptions, not the laws themselves, which exist independently of man (which I will call "logic" or "the facts of logic"). The laws of logic are different than the facts of logic in the same way a picture of a bowl of fruit is different than the actual bowl of fruit. To confuse the map for the place drawn on it is a very common thing I see the religious doing when talking about the laws and facts of logic, and I wish to get that out of the way early. 

I should also like to note that I use the word "law" in a scientific sense, meaning something that happens the same all the time given the same circumstances. This is not equivalent to, say, a state law that governs people. There is no governing involved, it's just a natural behavior of reality. It's how things fall into place necessarily. 

The laws of logic can be derived from three simple, fundamental laws: 

```
1. The Law of Identity: a thing is itself.
A = A        (A equals A)

2. The Law of Non-Contradiction: a thing can't not be itself.
A ≠ ¬A        (A not equal to not A)

3. The Law of Excluded Middle: a thing can't be itself and something else at the same time, in the same way.
A ∨ ¬A        (A or not A)
```

These laws are self-attesting truths. They're what are called *tautologies*: propositions that are always true. They're true even if you try to disprove them, because you assert their truth at the outset.

You can't disprove the Law of Identity, say, because in order to do that, you'd have to assume it's true in order to set up your argument. Even your argument is itself, and not something else. Just by having an argument against the three laws of logic, you've assumed their truth already.

These laws are represented with *logical statements* consisting of separate, distinct ideas, and *logical operators* which define the truth value of the whole statement: ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘not’, ‘if’, etc.

Logical proofs can be made using these types of logical statements along with inferences based on the definitions of the underlying laws of logic.

Logical arguments are laid out with a set of premises that lead to a conclusion. Example:

```
Premise: All men are mortal.
Premise: Socrates was a man.
Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates was mortal.
```

This argument is valid, because the conclusion logically follows from its premises. If all men are mortal, and if you are a man, then you are mortal. 

There are arguments that don't logically follow from their premises, however. Here is an example:

```
Premise: All men are mortal.
Premise: Socrates was mortal.
Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates was a man.
```

This argument is logically invalid, because there are other mortal beings than man. Socrates could be a dog's name. Just being mortal alone isn't enough to say that Socrates is necessarily a man. These arguments must be as explicit as possible, otherwise they can be found to lead to false conclusions unwittingly. 

The two dominating rules that an argument requires for being valid are:

1. The given premises must allow you to infer ONLY those conclusions that logically follow from them (the argument must be free of logical errors).

2. The given premises must allow you to infer ALL conclusions that logically follow from them (you can't pick and choose which conclusions you want, you have to own them all). 

If these two rules are not followed, then you have a bad argument.

It's important not only to know how to correctly set up a logical argument, but to be able to spot errors in your arguments and others'. Here I will teach you a few common ways an argument can be screwed-up, so that you can get a feel for these errors in real life discussion and even in the claims put forth to you from swindlers or salesmen. 

A breaking of the rules of logic is called a *logical fallacy*. Fallacies take many forms, but can be broken down into the same few types of general errors. 

Here are some commonly-heard logical fallacies in everyday life, what they're called, and why they're fallacious. 

### Strawman:

A strawman fallacy is a misrepresentation of another's argument that is argued against instead of their actual argument. 

If I say "There's no evidence that extraterrestrial life has visited Earth" and someone else responds "But how can you say aliens don't exist?", this would be a strawman. I didn't say aliens don't exist. I said there's no evidence they've visited Earth if they do exist. 

A strawman essentially puts words in your mouth that you did not say. If someone asked me "How can you disprove the Big Bang?" and I say "I don't know. Do I need to know every step of the process?" this would be a strawman. My opponent didn't say I needed to know every step of the process, that is a mischaracterization of their question. 


### Ad Hominem:

Ad hominem is Latin for "to the person." An ad hominem argument attempts to discredit the opponent's point by making a dig at the opponent's character without actually addressing their point. 

```
A: "I don't think circumcisions should be done. They're unnecessary procedures."
B: "That's funny coming from a Jew."
```

B's quip doesn't address A's point at all, it simply brings up A's character, which is irrelevant. This makes it an ad hominem. 


### Genetic Fallacy:

A genetic fallacy dismisses an argument not for its content, but for where the content comes from. "You can't trust X. You read it on Wikipedia." is a genetic fallacy because Wikipedia is perfectly capable of giving correct information as well as incorrect. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. "Why would you believe that government report? It is a documented fact that the government are lying scum!" Someone actually said this to me once. This is a genetic fallacy because it says nothing about the contents of the report, it blindly dismisses it as false simply because of where it came from. The readers who are paying attention will already identify ad hominem fallacies as a form of genetic fallacy.


### Appeal to Authority:

An appeal to authority asserts an argument as true simply because it came from a source the arguer deems trustworthy. Even experts in a certain field of study can be wrong about things in the very field in which they are an expert. This reasoning blindly deems as true things that could potentially be false simply because some expert said it. 

It is important to note that you can cite legitimate authorities to back up your case without being fallacious. The fallacy comes in when the only support you're providing for your case is that some expert agrees with you. Why do they agree with you? What gave them that view in the first place? Knowing this is superior to knowing that a certain authority holds that view because you can explain why they do and what led them to that conclusion, sometimes without even having to go to that authority. 

```
A: "B! You're alive! C told me this morning that you were dead!"
B: "Well I'm obviously not, because I'm standing right in front of you."
A: "But he's more reliable than you!"
```

Obviously this is a bit of a ridiculous situation, but here the fallacy is obvious. C may be more reliable than B, but that doesn't change the fact that C can be wrong sometimes. 


### Fallacy of Equivocation:

A fallacy of equivocation, sometimes just called an equivocation, is when you switch definitions of polysemic words in the middle of an argument, thereby giving way to misleading conclusions.

```
P1: "Nothing is better than eternal happiness."
P2: "Eating a hamburger is better than nothing."
C: "Therefore, eating a hamburger is better than eternal happiness."
```

The definition of the word "nothing" is changed in the middle of the argument from the definition apparent in the word's literal usage in premise one, to the word's idiomatic usage in premise two. This argument thus leads to a ridiculous conclusion with a train of logic that seems sound on the surface. 


### Argument from Ignorance Fallacy:

An argument from ignorance fallacy (argument from ignorance for short) is when you favor one explanation because you can't imagine any others being possible, favor thinking something is false because it can't be proven true, or true because it can't be proven false. 

"Building 7 of the World Trade Center must have been taken down in a controlled demolition! How else could it have collapsed if no planes hit it?" is an argument from ignorance. Just because you can't imagine why it could have collapsed, doesn't mean it could not have, and it doesn't mean you can provide your own custom answer just because it makes sense to you. You have to have evidence to support it. 

Arthur Conan Doyle's storybook character Sherlock Holmes famously said "If you eliminate all other possibilities, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth!" This isn't a pearl of detective's wisdom, it is an argument from ignorance. Just because you've eliminated all explanations but one doesn't make that explanation win by default. That explanation still needs evidence to support it, and if it doesn't, the answer to the conundrum must be "I don't know" until you have such evidence. 


### Red Herring:

A red herring is an unrelated or irrelevant point thrown into a debate to throw the opponent off-topic. It's not meant to be a legitimate question, it's meant to try to back oneself out of a corner. 

```
A: "What makes homeopathy effective?"
B: "Homeopathy has cured a plethora of ailments in hundreds of people, according to our reports!"
A: "Okay, but what makes homeopathy effective?"
```

A asked what about homeopathy makes it an effective treatment. B only said that it *was* effective, not *how* it was effective, so he didn't answer A's question, just talked about something unrelated to the question. 


### Loaded Question:

A loaded question is a question that is asked in a way that assumes things. "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?" If I say yes, I'm admitting I have beat my wife in the past. If I say no, I'm still doing it. The question tries to trap you in a specific set of parameters so that only certain answers actually answer the question. "Do you agree that your statement is fallacious?" is one I hear a lot. It's a loaded question because it assumes my statement is fallacious. I will not agree that my statement is fallacious until you show me why it is. Blindly asserting a fallacy does not make the statement fallacious. 


### Sweeping Generalization:

A generalization tries to assert that a small number of cases is the norm for all others. Just because you saw one person get the flu shot and proceed to get the flu thereafter does not mean flu shots in general are ineffective. Just because you see that cheap food is generally unhealthy processed food doesn't mean all cheap food is unhealthy. Produce and dry foods are actually pretty cheap.


### Circular Reasoning:

This is when you set up an argument in a way that the thing you're trying to argue is already assumed in your premises. "President Reagan was a great communicator because he had the knack of talking effectively to the people." Well ok, but that's not saying anything new. You're saying Reagan was an effective communicator because he was an effective communicator. Circular arguments tend to restate the premise in the conclusion rather than inferring new information off of it. "This movie is rated R because it is unsuitable for children." Well yeah, that's what an R rating means. You're not providing anything new.


### Fallacy of False Choice:

This sets up a question or conclusion in a way that makes you think it could only be one of a few possibilities, while ignoring that it could be none of the above. "Well what do you say Jesus is? A liar, a lunatic, or the Lord?" Neither. He could be a made-up story. He could have been a normal person whose life had been greatly exaggerated through oral storytelling. Provide evidence for who he is, don't ask leading questions.


### Fallacy of Bifurcation:

This presents to you an either/or situation without consideration of (or outright denial of) other possibilities. "Either the universe was created by a Creator, or it came from nothing." No, that's absurd. The universe could have always existed, etc. Boxing someone into only two possibilities is short-sighted and only works on people who haven't considered other possibilities or who already agree with one of the branches of the bifurcation.


### Causal Oversimplification:

An attempt to explain a conclusion with insufficient evidence, cloaked under plausible deniability. "Sorry officer, I ran off the road because a deer jumped in front of me!" "Oh really? So it wasn't because you were drunk and on your phone?" Whether there was a deer or not, there were nevertheless multiple reasons why he ran his car off the road, and isolating one is dishonest.


### Shifting the Burden of Proof:

When presenting a claim with the intent to convince, it's not up to the other person to prove you wrong, it's up to *you* to prove yourself right if you want to be believed. Called "onus probandi" in formal debate, a shift in the burden of proof occurs when you make a claim, and when questioned, attempt to shift your burden of demonstrating your claim onto the person questioning it, asking them how it could be false. 
```
A: "Evolution isn't true."
B: "Why do you think that?"
A: "Well what's the evidence it is?"
```
This is *blatant* dishonesty. If you say evolution isn't true, demonstrate it.


### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:

Meaning "after this, therefore because of this", post hoc ergo propter hoc is a fallacy where you assert that something happened, and then some other thing happened, and so the second thing must have been caused by the first. A woman goes out to her yard every day and screams at the top of her lungs "BEGONE TERRIBLE TIGERS!" A neighbor of hers gets annoyed and tells her "You know that doesn't deter any tigers, right?" She responds: "Well do you see any tigers around?" "No, we live in the US, there's no tigers for thousands of miles." "See? It works!"

Anti-vaccination activists frequently use this argument to assert vaccines are harmful. "My baby got these vaccines and then got sick, therefore the sickness HAS to be from the vaccines!" No, it doesn't. It could have come from countless other sources, you're just choosing not to consider them to push your personal agenda.


### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:

Meaning "with this, therefore because of this", this fallacy asserts that two things happened at once, therefore the effect of one was brought on by the presence of the other. Or, certain events have always been accompanied by certain other events, therefore one caused the other. A famous example of this is the "Redskins' Rule", which holds that from 1936 onwards, whether the Redskins win or lose a match has correlated perfectly with which candidate won the US Presidential election for those election years. This has held true from 1936 until the 2004 Bush/Kerry elections, showing that *correlation doesn't imply causation*. Remember this phrase.

These above categories only scratch the surface, however, as humans are clever masters of deception, and are constantly coming up with loopholes to avoid the truth. This will hopefully get you started on your journey of unraveling the tangled webs of absurdity that we weave every day.
