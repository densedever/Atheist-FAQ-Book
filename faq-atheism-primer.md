# Primer on Atheism

There seems to be a lot of confusion in my experience with the religious on what atheism is. Some say it's a religion, some say it's a worldview. But atheism is very simple. 

*Atheism can succinctly be defined as the disbelief of any deity or claims of any deity's existence, "deity" meaning the god of whatever religion you wish to choose: the God of the Bible, Allah, etc.*

There are atheists who don't have a belief about God either way. These are what are called the "weak atheists." They don't believe or claim to believe that God exists or doesn't. They don't have enough knowledge of the subject to be able to form an opinion at this time, either because they never cared, never thought about it, or have thought about it and are just not sure.

There are atheists that believe that no Gods exist. None. No Gods, no higher powers, they don't exist at all. These are the "strong atheists." Upon seeing no evidence that God exists, or thinking that the concept of a God is impossible, redundant, or useless, they are convinced that God doesn't exist in reality, whether or not God actually exists.

The definition I gave for atheism applies equally well to both weak and strong atheists, and so I hold that definition of atheism throughout this book. This definition happens to coincide fairly well with many dictionary definitions of the word, which are mainly "The lack of belief in deities, or the belief that no such deities exist." 

I shall now deal with two of the main strawmen about atheism. 

## 1. "Atheism is a worldview."

This is absolutely backward. One's worldview can *result* in atheism or theism. Atheism or theism are results of worldviews, not themselves worldviews. For example, if your knowledge base includes those forces observed in the universe, the strong/weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity, and no other forces, then your observation of the universe will be shaped around your knowledge of those forces, thus making you a naturalist. You aren't a naturalist because you choose to be one, it's a result of your knowledge base and conclusions drawn therein.

## 2. "Atheism is a religion."

Religion is defined by Merriem-Webster in a few ways, and I will list the useful (to this book) definitions here: 

1. the service and worship of God or the supernatural,
2. a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices,
4. a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith.

The first definition immediately prevents atheism from being a religion, as atheists are defined as those who disbelieve claims for God's existence, as per this book's given definition. 

The second may seem to the religious as fitting of atheism, however it's important to note the "and" statement in the definition, as wording is important to convey meaning: "system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices." All three of these have to be present in order for this definition to hold, because that's how "and" works. The only connecting thread of all atheists on earth is that they don't believe deities or higher powers exist, regardless of whether or not they do, and regardless of how they came to that belief. Atheists do not share "attitudes", in fact atheists are as varied as anyone else. They don't share beliefs, as one could believe life and the universe could have come from something wildly imaginative, and if that something isn't a deity, they're still atheists simply because it's not a deity. 

The final definition, "a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith", doesn't exactly fit, either. Atheism isn't a cause, as a cause has a *goal*, whereas being unconvinced of a claim is a *result*. It's not a principle in and of itself, rather the result of applied principles in an observation of reality as it is. It can try to be called a "system of beliefs", except that the only thing every atheist has in common is disbelief in gods. 

"held to with ardor" and "held to with faith" are two different things. You can be certain of something either because it's actually true and you know it's true, or because you simply believe it to be true and don't desire to change that belief. That certainty is a result of proper education in the former, and willful ignorance and arrogance in the latter. Sadly, the latter seems to be more often the case.

Holding to something with faith entails holding a belief whether or not you have good evidence for it. If you do have evidence, then you can make your case on the evidence, and be right or wrong with that case. If you have no evidence, and are just relying on your staunch trust that your claim is correct, that's not useful to anyone, and I'd argue it's not useful to you either. It pays to believe things that are demonstrably true, because what you know now determines how you learn and filter new information. If what you know is false, you're going to draw more false conclusions in the future, and stubbornness and arrogance will ensure you preserve those false beliefs. Keep in mind that the legislators that make the laws that everyone in the nation has to abide by likely believe some false things themselves, and that is directly relevant to everyone's life through the existence of laws.
