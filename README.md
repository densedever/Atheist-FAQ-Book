intro: explanation of format, categories

format: question, commentary, answer, counterquestion (?) 
divide into multiple chapters if we find more questions?

Existence

“How would you define what truth is?”

“How does everything come from nothing?”

“How does one defend the argument of infinite regression when it flies in the face of the logic of a first cause?”

“If there is a cause beyond the whole finite (limited) universe, would not this cause have to be beyond the finite, namely, non-finite or infinite?”

“Do you believe in free will?  (free will being the ability to make choices without coersion).”

“Would you agree that something presently exists? If something presently exists, and something cannot come from nothing, then would you also agree that something must have always existed?”


Life and The Universe

“Where did the universe come from?”

“How can you believe that life is an accident and not a product of intelligent design?”

“Do human beings have any purpose?”

“If there is no God, how does your life have any meaning?”

“What happens when we die?”

“If we just pass out of existence when we die, then what significance does your life have?”

“Would you agree that if it took intelligence to make a model universe in a science lab, then it took super-intelligence to make the real universe?”


Atheism

“How would you define atheism?”

“How did you become an Atheist?”

“What is so appealing about being an atheist? Why do you choose atheism over Christianity?”


Morality

“Where does morality come from?”

“Are there moral absolutes?”

“Do you believe there is such a thing as evil?  If so, what is it?”

“If there is no God, can we do what we want? Are we free to murder and rape? While good deeds are unrewarded?”

“What basis do you have for calling any actions good or bad?”

Presuppositionalism

“Could you be wrong about everything you think you know?”

“Out of all the knowledge in the universe, how much of that knowledge do you have?”

“How do you know your reasoning is valid? How do you justify your reasoning?”

“What is your basis for epistemology?”

“How can you trust your senses?”

“How do you know what is real?”

“How do you know that the laws of physics will apply 5 seconds from now?”


Reason, Logic, and Evidence

“Do you have absolute verifiable proof God does not exist?”

“What if you’re wrong?”

“Atheists say that they would be convinced by evidence. What evidence would they accept as evidence for the existence of God that they would not think is better explained by naturalism?”

“How sure are you that your atheism properly represents reality?”

“How sure are you that your atheism is correct?”

“Why do you believe your atheism is a justifiable position to hold?”

“Must God be known through the scientific method?”

“If God must be known by the scientific method, then how do you avoid a category mistake by requiring material evidence of an immaterial God?”

“What would it take for you to believe in God? What would constitute sufficient evidence for God’s existence?”

“What if you’re wrong and there really is a Heaven?”

“Is it impossible for God to exist?”


Religion and Worldviews

“Why question just Christians, why not Paganism or New Age movements, for example?”

“If the atheist is so secure in their non-belief of God, why do they show up trying to convince Christians otherwise, and what do they have to gain in their worldview by doing so?”

“Are you a materialist or a physicalist or what?”

“Do you affirm or deny that atheism is a worldview?  Why or why not?”

“Not all atheists are antagonistic to Christianity but for those of you who are, why the antagonism?”

“If you were at one time a believer in the Christian God, what caused you to deny his existence?”

“Isn’t Atheism a religion too?”
