From a Facebook post from 2016:

Original post:

May 14, 2017 at 2:33 PM ·

I had a discussion today with the person who brought me to church about why I should believe Christianity. I'm currently an atheist, formerly a believer headed to seminary school.

I told him I was willing to accept it as true if he was willing to demonstrate it. Talk is cheap. Anyone can say anything, and everyone says their religion is the right one. Saying things and throwing Bible verses around isn't sufficient.

Christianity seems to me to be more and more of a closed loop the more I learn about it - inaccessible from anywhere besides presupposed belief in a God that you have to open yourself up to believing, that you have to ask into your life, and that won't throw you a bone unless you're wanting him to be real in the first place. It's why it has to be spread through indoctrination, force, or ignorance.

I told him that opening myself up to a god in which I have been given no reason to believe exists in the first place is self-delusion through establishing my own biases.

From a philosophical perspective, there is very little we can actually say we know, and saying we know what happens after death when no one living has died yet is foolish and grasping.

After a bit of talking, he told me this type of discussion "sows discord." I responded with the fact that questioning your beliefs is a good thing because if you're not willing to do that, that shows you're more concerned about propagation of your religion than actual truth, otherwise you'd invite these types of discussions.

I said "Christianity could be true, but that's not enough. I won't believe it unless that truth can be demonstrated." I asked him "What do you think about this statement, is it reasonable or not? 'It is reasonable to believe that which is true?'" He dodged the question, saying "I don't think this is getting anywhere." You're right, sir, because you refuse to think about your beliefs.

It's not reasonable to believe that which is true, it's reasonable to believe that which has been demonstrated through observation and reproducible evidence to be true.

It's easier to shove away the things that call your worldview into question than accept new information and have to build a new foundation for understanding the world. He demonstrated with every word that he was doing nothing but shoving my questions under the carpet, never to think about them again. He was already right, and I was already wrong, and that was the end of it.

It goes without saying that he wants nothing to do with me anymore. Of course, that's sadly to be expected. Going to show he can't build relationships with people if he sees no chance of changing their mind. Utterly sad.

Ensuing discussion:

Jim-chriss Charles That's why there is FAITH. Without it even if 1000 wonders or miracles were to be performed before you. You won't believe it. But trust me @Dylan GOD exists.

Dylan LaCoursiere Those wonders and miracles have to be distinguished from my own imaginings. If I saw an angel one day, which would make more sense to conclude? That supernatural beings such as angels exist, or that something is up with my brain (that same something that has happened countless times throughout human history)?

Jim-chriss Charles Let me tell you something @Dylan. Once i thought the power of GOD lies in the miracles and wonders alone. Those are only by-products. First READ the WORD (take time and read), even if you read it like a novel but the more you read you will see how powerful it reflects how we/you are supposed to live.

Dylan LaCoursiere Wouldn't God's power unambiguously and unmistakably show itself in nature instead of needing to be interpreted through a word written by fallible man in a way that doesn't itself warrant belief over any other claim?

God's all-powerful. He can do that. Not everyone's convinced by the beauty of a sunset or something.

Dylan LaCoursiere I did that and this is how it turned out. I was a Christian for a number of years. A member of my church, a street witness handing out tracts, and on my way to seminary to become an apologist.

It was only after I started examining the reasoning that originally convinced me that I realized I was convinced for bad reasons.

I haven't found any good reasons to this day. Only more claims.

Dylan LaCoursiere Can you define the power of the holy spirit like no Christian I've talked to in the last decade ever could?

I thought I did at the time, I was driven by the desire not to see a single soul in hell, utterly convinced of the reality of God, Satan, heaven, hell, sin, etc. and it seeped into every aspect of my life from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep.

I thought I was given the strength to face the world's depravity, to face my own sins, to bring light into the world, what other drive will you also have?

Jim-chriss Charles So you mean you don't wanna believe in GOD's existence but you wanna believe in the opposite. That He doesn't exist! So, in another perspective...what is the probability he doesn't exist? If you say 100% i will ask you, why do you believe in every action there is an equal and opposite reaction?!

Dylan LaCoursiere You weren't, Jim. Where did you get that idea? I wasn't even insulting God. I just said the word "god" and "dick" in the same sentence, a sentence about a hypothetical.

As to your assertion: I do want God to exist. I do want Christianity to be true.

However, I have to deal with the fact that, with my current knowledge, I have no reason to think any gods exist.

That can change! It just hasn't yet.

Dylan LaCoursiere Do you know what you saw? Can you connect what you saw to your version of religion? How?

Not tempting the Lord is the Bible's cop-out for saying a bunch of things its writers can't possibly know or prove, especially when they were people who subscribed to other superstitions, who weren't even the most advanced civilizations in the world at the time (the Chinese had them beat by a long shot), and who didn't know much of anything about the workings of the universe.
