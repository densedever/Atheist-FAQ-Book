Existence

“How would you define what truth is?”

Truth is that which is verifiable. It's what corresponds with reality. It is testable, observable, and reproducible, and the result can be seen by independent testers. Truth is also that which is self-attesting (such as a tautology or a priori knowledge), or that which has evidence to support it (although this is not strictly true, I am not convinced truths exist for which there is no evidence of their truth, regardless of whether or not such evidence has been found). 

This question seems to come up as kind of a way to ask "What do you think the truth is?" This is an irrelevant question because it doesn't matter what I think is true, it matters what's supported by evidence. No one has a monopoly on truth. 

I see countless people make unsubstantiated claims and, when asked to support those claims, turn around and say "I'm not here to debate" or "I don't want to fight about it", which roughly translates to "I am not confident I can support the fine details of my belief" more often than not. I am never scared of a debate. I will discuss anything, anytime, with anyone. I've even argued with roomfuls of people for hours. I'm not scared to defend my views and will promptly do so whenever asked, because I can provide evidence for what I know and can admit when I'm wrong and update my views when I'm given new information. It's a win-win either way. 


“How does everything come from nothing?”

There are two questions that immediately come to mind when I'm asked this question. 1. Who is asserting everything comes from nothing? 2. What is nothing?

I don't know (nor have I heard of) anyone who actually believes everything came from nothing. The question of where everything came from is still unanswered, but to claim it came from nothing or even from something is trying to answer an unknown with another unknown. "Can everything come from nothing?" is a question that needs to be answered before we can discuss "how" it came from nothing. If it's not possible in the first place, why ask how it could happen?

Furthermore, what is "nothing"? Is "nothing" even a logically coherent concept? Nothing is typically defined as "non-being", or "lack of something." So does nothing exist? Of course something exists. I exist. Stars exist. A cheese pizza from Domino's exists, but does nothing exist? If so, where is it? Can you show me an example of nothing? Even empty space is filled with energy, and I think you would agree that energy is not nothing. Does it even make sense for nothing to have a location? 

For something to exist, it has to have substance (because not consisting of anything is nothing by definition), and it has to have properties (because it can be described in some way if it has substance, even if the description is minimal). To talk about a thing, we talk about what the thing is, and what it has. X is big. X is electrically conductive. X is located 30 yards from the farmhouse. X has a length of 3 feet. X has a cup sitting on it. X has feathers. 

Let's apply this to nothing. Nothing does nothing, has no length, width, or height, is not conductive or inductive, absorbs nothing, radiates nothing... it is an absence. In order to talk about something, you have to have something to talk about. So where does this talk of nothing come from? If you say everything came from nothing, what are you talking about? If you claim something can't come from nothing, what are you talking about? This question is plainly nonsensical. 


“How does one defend the argument of infinite regression when it flies in the face of the logic of a first cause?”

The topic of firsts comes up a lot in a debate of origins. "What was the first object?" "What was the first mover of the first object?" "Where did that object come from?" "Where did that come from?" And on and on, ad infinitum. This is infinite regression. 

Theists attacking the argument of infinite regression are asserting that there was a finite regression - a first originator. Not only the first originator, but an originator that itself had no origin. 

Let's say I concede this argument. There must be some first cause for existence. What is that cause? Of course you think it's your favorite deity, but what about this argument is supposed to tell me that? The first mover argument really tells me nothing more than that existence must have had a cause. 

I don't agree that the first cause argument really has any logic behind it. The thing is, I also don't agree that infinite regression does. This area is an unknown for me, and I don't necessarily agree that infinite regression can't happen. We just don't know. Whereof you do not know, thereof you should not speak. 


“If there is a cause beyond the whole finite (limited) universe, would not this cause have to be infinite?”

No, this doesn't logically follow. It could be that the cause is simply greater, or even lesser, as complexity can often arise from simplicity. Software engineers working with AI know this quite well. Even if I were to concede that yes, it must be infinite, what would be that cause? This question alone does not lead me to an answer to that. 


“Do you believe in free will?  (free will being the ability to make choices without coersion).”

I don’t think it matters either way. If you look at two people in two separate realities that are exactly the same, except that the person in the first reality has free will and the second person in the second reality doesn’t, could you see a difference? If so, what is it?


“Would you agree that something presently exists? If something presently exists, and something cannot come from nothing, then would you also agree that something must have always existed?”

I do agree that something presently exists. I also agree that something cannot come from nothing, as far as that would make sense. As to whether or not I think something has always existed? I would have to say yes, due to the impossibility of the contrary. 

Nothing doesn't exist to be able to give rise to something, so I think it's reasonable to believe that something has always existed, if we assume causality and only certain views of time. However it's when we don't that this discussion trails off into futility, because it's then speculation. We live in a universe where time and causality exist and work, so positing a frame of existence different than this is nothing but philosophical. 


Life and The Universe

“Where did the universe come from?”

This question is unanswered. All evidence (such as red shifting of starlight and the CMBR) suggests that the universe was in a state of existence that was much hotter and denser than it is today, and that it held this state roughly 13.7 billion years ago. How it was before this, though, is a mystery, because the equations used to describe the universe and its laws in its present state don't work to describe its previous state. The best answer I can give is "I don't know", which is a perfectly acceptable answer to the question. 

To state you do know how the universe came about, you need to have evidence for your position. Giving an answer like "God did it" is insufficient, as it does not describe a process, the materials involved, or the action taken, nor does it give any useful knowledge or predictions that can be used to learn more about the universe or derive new knowledge. It is simply a generic, blanket answer. 


“How can you believe that life is an accident and not a product of intelligent design?”

Firstly, this asserts that I believe life is an accident, which is a strawman. Life arose from the natural interactions of chemicals. Granted, the state of those chemicals coming into contact in such a way as to react to build self-replicating systems is extraordinary, but the process is guided by chemistry the whole way through. Secondly, it asserts that life is either an accident or a product of intelligent design, which is a fallacy of bifurcation. How do you know those are the only choices? Thirdly, it asserts that if life is not an accident, then it is a product of intelligent design, which affirms the consequent. Both propositions need evidence to support them, and disproving one of them doesn't prove the other. 


“Do human beings have any purpose?”

This question is normally asked to mean "Do humans have any ultimate, overarching purpose in the universe?" I see no reason to think we do. We're highly insignificant in the universe. All we are and have ever known or experienced in our entire history rests on one planet of hundreds of millions, in one galaxy of hundreds of billions, in one star cluster of hundreds of billions. To derive significance from this is something I can't see as anything short of the utmost arrogance. 

Do we need a purpose in the first place? What is the significance of that, and why would we need it or have it? What tangible, definable characteristics does having a purpose give us? Can you tell the difference between someone with a purpose and someone without? I don't understand why some people would think this is significant. 


“If there is no God, how does your life have any meaning?”

If there really is no afterlife, that means this is the only time I have to be able to experience the world and interact with the reality of which I am a part. This is my one shot to learn, to love, to laugh, to play, to hurt, to cry, to grow, to live... It has the utmost significance to me. I could have just not existed. This realization is all I need to be thankful for every precious day I'm on this planet. I am extremely privileged to be here at all. To think that this journey through life could be so diminished as to be meaningless simply because your favorite deity does not enter in on it is unimaginably insulting, degrading, and arrogant. 

Besides, not having a God in the picture allows me to seriously consider my actions and behavior toward other people. If there is no God, then that means I am responsible for my actions. Satan's not tempting me to do evil, I'm not predisposed to do evil because I have a "sinful nature", and I'm not more willing to do good because I've been "saved." My actions will have the consequences they do, and I have to deal with them on my own terms. This right here is enough to keep me from lying, stealing, or cheating. 

Everybody dies. This fact alone is what motivates me to do good; to treat people right; to give to the less fortunate; to help people out; to bring injustice to light; to love my fellow human species. This is what gives my life meaning: someday I won't be here. It is as simple as that. 

Besides, why is a deity needed in order for your life to have meaning?I've not heard one satisfying answer from anyone before. 


“What happens when we die?”

This is a claim that is able to be tested, and has been for a long time. [talk about brain death vs bodily death, talk about consciousness and brains]


“If we just pass out of existence when we die, then what significance does your life have?”

In my opinion, if you will just pass out of existence when you die, then that means the time you did exist is of the utmost significance. That is the short, special time you have to be able to experience the world. Your life may be an infinitesimally small blip on the universe's radar, but to you, it's your entire reality. 


“Would you agree that if it took intelligence to make a model universe in a science lab, then it took super-intelligence to make the real universe?”



Atheism

“How would you define atheism?”

The most succinct and flexible definition of atheism I can present is "disbelief in God." This definition applies equally to weak atheism ("I don't have a belief about God's existence.") and strong atheism ("I believe God does not exist."). To state either of those positions is to implicitly admit a disbelief in God, whether or not you actually believe no gods exist. 

Atheism is a position. You say "God exists", I say "I'm not convinced." That's all it takes to be an atheist. Not only is it a position, it is simply a single position on a single issue: whether you believe a God or gods exist. Not whether they actually do or not, but whether you believe they do or not. 

Atheism is not a worldview, as you could believe in any number of fantastical things such as fairies, magic, witchcraft, demons, superstition, spirituality, an afterlife, aliens, mermaids, luck, ghosts, and so on, and as long as you don't believe in any gods, you are an atheist. It is a single position on a single issue. Naturalism, realism, and materialism are worldviews, but atheism is not. To say it is is a strawman. 


"How would you define agnosticism?"

Agnosticism, if we're talking about religion (because you can be agnostic about anything), is defined as being unknowing of God's existence. "Do you think God exists?" If you say "I don't know if God exists", you're an agnostic toward the existence of that god. 

Agnosticism, like atheism, is a single position on a single issue. "Do you know if God exists?" "No." You're an agnostic. 

An important thing to note is that agnosticism has to do with knowledge, while atheism has to do with belief. You can be both an agnostic and an atheist at the same time - they're not mutually exclusive. In the same way, you can be both a gnostic and a theist at the same time. I don't know that God exists, therefore I am an agnostic. I don't believe that God exists, therefore I am an atheist. I am thus an agnostic atheist. 


“How did you become an Atheist?”

[should this be answered in a different part of the book?]

“What is so appealing about being an atheist? Why do you choose atheism over Christianity?”


Morality

“Where does morality come from?”

“Are there moral absolutes?”

“Do you believe there is such a thing as evil?  If so, what is it?”

“If there is no God, can we do what we want? Are we free to murder and rape? While good deeds are unrewarded?”

"If a guy kidnaps three kids, rapes them, shoots them, and then kills himself, what's his punishment?"

“What basis do you have for calling any actions good or bad?”


Presuppositionalism

“Could you be wrong about everything you think you know?”

“Out of all the knowledge in the universe, how much of that knowledge do you have?”

“How do you know your reasoning is valid? How do you justify your reasoning?”

“What is your basis for epistemology?”

“How can you trust your senses?”

“How do you know what is real?”

“How do you know that the laws of physics will apply 5 seconds from now?”


Reason, Logic, and Evidence

“Do you have absolute, verifiable proof God does not exist?”

“What if you’re wrong?”

“Atheists say that they would be convinced by evidence. What evidence would they accept as evidence for the existence of God that they would not think is better explained by naturalism?”

“How sure are you that your atheism properly represents reality?”

“How sure are you that your atheism is correct?”

“Why do you believe your atheism is a justifiable position to hold?”

“Must God be known through the scientific method?”

“If God must be known by the scientific method, then how do you avoid a category mistake by requiring material evidence of an immaterial God?”

“What would it take for you to believe in God? What would constitute sufficient evidence for God’s existence?”

“What if you’re wrong and there really is a Heaven?”

“Is it impossible for God to exist?”


Religion and Worldviews

“Why question just Christians, why not Paganism or New Age movements, for example?”

“If the atheist is so secure in their non-belief of God, why do they show up trying to convince Christians otherwise, and what do they have to gain in their worldview by doing so?”

“Are you a materialist or a physicalist or what?”

“Do you affirm or deny that atheism is a worldview?  Why or why not?”

“Not all atheists are antagonistic to Christianity but for those of you who are, why the antagonism?”

“If you were at one time a believer in the Christian God, what caused you to deny his existence?”

“Isn’t Atheism a religion too?”
