# Atheism FAQ Introduction

Introduction

Everyone has their own view of the world. Some are justified in their worldviews, some are not. Many can’t imagine the world being any other way than the way they see it. For those of you who can, I commend you. That is a sign of intelligence. For those of you who can’t, a look into other worldviews could be eye-opening. 

I was raised around a lot of religious people, and upon talking with them about their beliefs, most have said that their religious view of the world is all they’ve ever known or seriously considered. Unfortunately, this mindset isn’t isolated to a few regions, it exists everywhere in every culture. My aim is to share my worldview. 

Because this book stems from my own experiences, I’m going to be talking about myself a lot in this work, so why not start now? I am an agnostic atheist. I don’t know if a god exists, and I don’t claim to believe in one. This also means I don’t believe in any kind of an afterlife. No God, no Satan, no Heaven, no Hell, no eternal punishment, no eternity at all, in fact. I am a realist: I take the world as it is and try to form accurate ideas about its nature based on what can be demonstrated with reproducible evidence and only that, as far as I can. I am a materialist: I am confident that material (atoms, particles, etc.) is all there is; everything else manifests as a result of the interactions between materials or emergent properties of underlying dynamics of the system. I am also a naturalist: I am confident that the only forces at work in the universe are physical forces derived from material interactions.

I’m interested in people’s beliefs: what they are, and how they are formed. Theology and religion are of particular interest to me. Thus I’ve had many conversations with the religious about what they believe and why. Many religious people have told me that my atheism is not justified. I disagree. The reasons I disagree are vast; I could write an entire book about them. This is that book.

I hope to be able to explain my worldview, why I hold it, and why I think it’s justified, to the religious who see atheism as absurd. Whether you believe me or not is not important to me. What is important to me is that you come to your worldview, whatever that may be, through a justified method of critical thought.

The tool exists that allows you to identify and separate truth and fact from lie and fantasy. It’s called critical thinking. Philosophies using critical thinking as their base can take on some different forms, but the one I hold to is skepticism, which holds that the truth of a claim should be doubted until there is evidence in support of it, as far as is practical. If the evidence is inconclusive, if multiple explanations account for the phenomena without being able to be eliminated, or if it’s impossible to gather evidence for the claim, it is classified as an unknown. Of course if you tell me "Hey I just got a new pet dog!", I'm not necessarily going to disbelieve you because it's not a huge claim, but feel free to send me pictures of your dog anyway!

The first part of the book will be about describing this tool to you and teaching you how to use it and apply it to real arguments, as well as what makes this tool able to find the truth or its best approximation. I also show you how an argument can fail, how the rules of logic can be broken, and how to spot logical errors. This is explained in the section “A Primer on Logic.” In order to explain an atheistic, materialistic worldview to you, it is proper to define my terms and explain what I mean, to minimize confusion on the subject matter. This is explained in the section “A Primer on Atheism.” In this section, I also explain a plethora of other worldviews, such as idealism or solipsism.

In order to use this information going into a discussion of really any topic at all, you need to be able actually to get somewhere with the person with which you’re speaking. There are ways to discuss things that are messy, frustrating, and futile, and there are ways to discuss matters that are straightforward, enlightening, and productive. I have provided some guidelines on how to have a productive discussion with people in the section “How to Have a Productive Discussion.” If followed, you should more easily be able to effectively get your ideas across and hold your own during a debate. Sometimes, even whole 3-hour-long discussions can be shut down from the start. I’ve learned these by myself in my own conversations from the ground up. I’ll save you from making the same mistakes I did.

Whether you get into debates or not, whether you find logic interesting or not, I hope by the end of this book you will better understand a position different from yours, or if you are of a similar worldview as I, will see your worldview from someone else’s perspective. Just because you’re an atheist doesn’t mean you hold that position for justified reasons, so I hope to give those to you now.

Happy thinking, 

Dylan LaCoursiere
