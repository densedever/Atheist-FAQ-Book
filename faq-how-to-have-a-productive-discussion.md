# How to Have a Productive Discussion

The first and foremost thing to keep in mind when having a discussion is be nice, polite, and mature to the other person. No one likes talking with an asshole. If your opponent is acting this way, keep your temper and be courteous anyway. It will not only piss the other person off more, it will make you look good. You want to come off as a calm person because that will give you credibility and will make people more willing to discuss things with you. 

Give your opponent the benefit of the doubt. On the internet, intentions aren't always clear. If someone says something in a debate that you find arrogant or offensive, or is obviously an attack aimed at you, assume they're being sarcastic or making a joke. Don't let it get to you, or you will lose your cool, and you might as well not respond at all when that happens. If it happens consistently, point it out to he person that attacks will not work and that actually making a case for yourself will do much better. Their response to that will tell you whether or not they're simply trolling you. 

Educate, don't insult. Calling someone stupid is meaningless if the person doesn't know which of whT he said makes him look stupid or why it is stupid. Explain to the person why they are wrong or what points are flawed in no uncertain terms. Educate the person. If someone calls you a moron, ask them why they think that way and ask them to correct you, if they're so confident you're wrong. If they can't, then that's just evidence that you're not the moron here. 

Try to get on the same page early. I've gone through hours-long discussions that seemed to have gotten somewhere only to find out two hours in that we were thinking of two totally different things the whole time. Define the words you use and the arguments you present clearly, right at the beginning, so you're both talking about the same thing. If needed, ask clarifying questions about what your opponent is saying anywhere in the discussion you need to so you can understand where your opponent is coming from. 

Stay on topic and try to bring home stray discussions. Staying on topic is crucial for progress. If your opponent can't defend their position, they will often start talking about other things to try to steer the discussion in a way that's advantageous to them. Don't let them do that. When I need to talk about something else, I explicitly make it known that I need to go off topic for a moment and also why I need to go off-topic, before just transitioning into other topics. 

See the bigger picture of your opponent's argument. Knowing exactly what your opponent is talking about and where they're coming from will allow you to construct better arguments against them.

Don't talk unless you know what you're talking about. 

Always be open to new information. 

Be willing to admit you're wrong. 

If an argument you use is shown to be false, never use it again.
